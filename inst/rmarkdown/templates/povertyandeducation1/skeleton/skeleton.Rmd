```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load your libraries here

library('lehmansociology')
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

We're going to get the state level percent poverty and percent less than high school.

````{r}
#type your code here
poverty13<-select (poverty.states, FIPStxt, Area_Name, PCTPOVALL_2013)

lessthanhighschool13 <- select(education.states, Area.name, FIPS.Code, Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013)

education_and_poverty<-merge(poverty13, lessthanhighschool13, by.x='Area_Name', by.y='Area.name')

````

Now let's make a dotplot to show the distribution of the data for percent of the adult population that has less than a high school degree.

```{r}
ggplot(education_and_poverty,
       aes(x=Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013),
       scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL)) +
     geom_dotplot(binwidth=.25 ) +
     geom_rug() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  ggtitle("Fig # : Distribution of Percent of Adults with Less Than a High School Diploma (for States)")
```

Now make a dot plot for percent of the population living in poverty. 
Copy the code chunk and make appropriate changes.


Now let's get the summary data for both variables. (Use the example as a model for the second variable.) 

```{r}
# summary(education_and_poverty$PCTPOVALL_2013)


```

Write your summary of the two distributions here.

Last but not least, let's look at the relationship between the two variables by making a scatter plot.


```{r}

ggplot(education_and_poverty,
       aes(x=Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013,
           y=PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = lm) +
  ggtitle("Fig # : Poverty Rate and High School Completion (for States)")

```
If you want to get fancy you can change:
    geom_point() 
    to 
    geom_text(aes(label = Area_Name))

What is the relationship between the percent with less than a high school diploma 
and the level of poverty in a state?

What is the slope (approximately)?
