This document examines different ways of representing a single variable visually.
Univariate is the adjective meaning single variable.

Sometimes we are really interested in describing a single variable, and that description by itself may be an important result or part of a document.
At other times, we may want to examine the relationship between two variables (bivariate analysis) or many variables at the same time (multivariate analysis), but before moving to examining the relationship between variables, it is always a good idea to look at the univariate distributions of the variables and make sure you understand them. 

We can explore data with numerical summaries of various kinds, but often a visual summary is
even more effective.

```{r}
# Set up some data
poverty13<-select (poverty.states, FIPStxt, Area_Name, PCTPOVALL_2013)
poverty13$FIPS.Code<-as.integer(poverty13$FIPStxt)

lessthanhighschool13 <- select(education.states, Area.name, FIPS.Code, Percent.of.adults.with.less.than.a.high.school.diploma..2009.2013)

education_and_poverty<-merge(poverty13, lessthanhighschool13, by.x='FIPS.Code', by.y='FIPS.Code')
```

## Interval variables

Let's start by looking at interval and ratio variables variables. 
These are variables with numerical meanings.
These variables can be either discrete or continuous.

Is the percent of population in a state who lives in poverty a discrete variable or a continuous variable?


We are going to start with three related graphs:
* stem and leaf
* dot plot, and
* histogram.

Make sure you add a title and labels. You can also change colors and other details.

````{r}
# Stem and leaf
stem(education_and_poverty$PCTPOVALL_2013, scale = 2)

# Dot plot
ggplot(education_and_poverty,
       aes(x=PCTPOVALL_2013),
       scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL)) +
     geom_dotplot(binwidth=1) +
     geom_rug() +
  labs( x="Percent in Poverty") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=NULL) +
  ggtitle("Fig # :")

# Histogram

ggplot(education_and_poverty, aes(PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1) +
  labs(y = "Count",     x="Percent in Poverty") +
  ggtitle("Fig # :")

````
Some things you may want to do to make the interpretation of the dotplot and histogram a bit easier are:
 make the x axis have the same tick marks (numbers and lines)
 change the binwidth to match (try .5 or 1 for example, but others too)
 add some vertical lines, such as for the mean, median and quartiles
 
Layers you might want to add (which will add vertical lines).  
Make sure you have a + sign at the end of lines before new lines you add.

 geom_vline(aes ( xintercept  = median(education_and_poverty$PCTPOVALL_2013)))
 geom_vline(aes ( xintercept  = mean(education_and_poverty$PCTPOVALL_2013)))


 quartile1 <- quantile(education_and_poverty$PCTPOVALL_2013, probs=c(.25))
 quartile3 <- quantile(education_and_poverty$PCTPOVALL_2013, probs=c(.75))
 geom_vline(aes ( xintercept  = quartile1, color="red"))
 geom_vline(aes ( xintercept  = quartile3, color="blue"))

 Note that using these quartiles will create a warning message, but it is because of
a harmless bug so don't worry about it.
 Put the calculation of the quartiles before the creation of the graphs.


We'll also do a bar chart that technically has two variables, state and poverty rate.
In bar charts the x variable is discrete, so notice that there is a space between the bars.
```{r}

ggplot(education_and_poverty, 
       aes(x= reorder(Area_Name, PCTPOVALL_2013), y = PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(y = "Percent in Poverty",     x="State") +
     # This line is going to rotate the state names by 90 degrees. You can try other values.
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  ggtitle("Fig # :")

```



Working with a partner or group, try to figure out how the four representations of PCTPOVALL_2013 related to each other. 



 Also you can change colors and fonts.

 -How are they similar?
 -How are they different?
 -Which gives you the most detailed information?
 -Which (in your opinion) does best at showing you the distribution of the variable?
 
Now we are going to look at one more way to show the state level data that is only possible because the data are geographic: a map.

```{r}
# First we need to load an extra library
library(maps)
states_map <- map_data("state")

# We'll use this library if we want to play with colors in the maps
library("RColorBrewer")
```
If you look at the states_map data you will see that the state names are in lower case.
Unfortunately our Area_Name variable is in upper case so ... it won't match.  So first we have to deal with that and then we can merge the map data and our education_and_poverty data together.

```{r}
education_and_poverty$state = tolower(education_and_poverty$Area_Name)

education_and_poverty_map<-merge(states_map, education_and_poverty, 
                                 by.x = "region", by.y="state")


```


Next we make the map
```{r}
# If you want to try colors uncomment the next line and change to the color you want.
# Also uncomment the scale_fill_gradientn line.
# You can change the color and the number of colors.

#colors<-brewer.pal(7,"Greens")
ggplot(education_and_poverty_map, aes(x=long, y = lat, group = group, 
                                      map_id = region, fill = PCTPOVALL_2013)) +
  geom_map(map = education_and_poverty_map, color = "black" ) +
  #scale_fill_gradientn(colors=colors) +
  coord_map("polyconic") +
  ggtitle("Fig #: ")

  


```

Did the map give you any additional information? 

How useful is the map compared to the other formats?

If you were going to write a report about the distribution of poverty rates among states which graph or graphs would you include? Why?
